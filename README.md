  <summary><strong>ðŸ“‚ Dataset</strong></summary>

The dataset for this project is sourced from the [City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/business-licences-2013-to-2024/) and includes business licensing records from **2013 up to May 5, 2024**.

### **Key Attributes:**

- **Licence Details:** Licence number, status (issued, expired, cancelled, or gone out of business), issue date, and expiry date.
- **Business Information:** Business name, trade name, primary business type category, number of employees, licence fee paid.
- **Location Information:** Registered business addresses and geographic coordinates within city limits.

In total, this dataset comprises over **780,000 records**, presenting an extensive view of Vancouverâ€™s active business environment over an 11-year period.

> **Note:** As of May 2024, Vancouver streamlined its licensing categories from over 500 distinct types down to fewer than 100. However, for consistency and detailed historical analysis, this project utilizes the original (pre-consolidation) business categories provided in the dataset.

### **Data Privacy and Integrity:**

- Home-based businesses have partially redacted addresses to protect privacy.
- Each record is uniquely identified using a Licence Record Sequence Number (Licence RSN) to prevent duplication and ensure data integrity.

### **Dataset Visualization:**

- **Annual Licensing Trends:** Include the visualization titled: 
  - **Figure No. 28 (Part 1)** â€“ *"A graph for business licensing activity patterns and yearly contributions from business authorization fees in White Rock city from 2013-2024."*  
  - **Note:** Displays annual issued licence counts and total fees, highlighting economic fluctuations and growth trends over the study period.
